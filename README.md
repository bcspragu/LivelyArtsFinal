LivelyArtsFinal
===============

This is a Go application for the final of a class I'm taking.

Wait, is this an art class?
===========================

Yeah, kind of, but we're supposed to, like, incorporate our own interests, so...

What does it do?
================

Basically, we showed the class a bunch of dance videos and told them to type out words that they thought as they were watching, like a stream-of-consciousness kind of thing. Then we went around the room and had each person upload their thoughts into a word cloud being updated in **real-time**. Word cloud code unceremoniously stolen from a D3 example I found online somewhere.
