LivelyArtsFinal
===============

This is a Go application for the final of a class I'm taking.

Wait, is this an art class?
===========================

Yeah, kind of, but we're supposed to, like, incorporate our own interests, so...

What does it do?
================

Not much at the moment, working on it. The end goal for it is to support real-time voting on what's going to happen next for the presentation, which should be interesting.

App Engine?
===========

That's not a question, but yes, it currently is setup for AppEngine, which is awkward because I just realized that I'm going to need WebSockets, which doesn't float well with AppEngine. Oh well.
